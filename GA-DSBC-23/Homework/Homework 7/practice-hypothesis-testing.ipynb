    "The results from Exercise 4 and Exercise 5 are indeed related. \n",

    "In Exercise 4, we calculated a 95% confidence interval for the `NOX` data, which resulted in an interval of approximately (0.5446, 0.5648). This means that we are 95% confident that the true population mean of `NOX` lies within this interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Exercise 5, we conducted a hypothesis test to determine whether the mean of `NOX` is significantly different from its median (0.54). The p-value from this test was approximately 0.004514, which is less than the commonly used significance level of 0.05. Therefore, we rejected the null hypothesis and concluded that the true mean `NOX` value is different from the median `NOX` value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, if we look at the confidence interval from Exercise 4, we'll notice that the median value of 0.54 does not fall within this interval. This is consistent with the results of the hypothesis test in Exercise 5, where we concluded that the mean is different from the median.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, to generalize this to the relationship between hypothesis tests and confidence intervals:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A confidence interval gives a range of plausible values for a population parameter (like the mean) based on sample data. If a given value falls within this interval, we would not reject the null hypothesis that the population parameter is equal to that value at the corresponding significance level.\n",
    "- A hypothesis test assesses whether a sample statistic is significantly different from a hypothesized population parameter. If we reject the null hypothesis, it means that the hypothesized value falls outside of the confidence interval for that parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, if we're conducting a two-sided hypothesis test at significance level α, and we have a (1-α)100% confidence interval for a parameter, we will reject the null hypothesis that the parameter equals some value if and only if that value falls outside of our confidence interval."
