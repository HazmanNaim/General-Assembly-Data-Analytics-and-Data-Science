-- Homework 2 - Case in SQL and Grouping in SQL
-- Q1. Do our customers prefer a certain type of shipping class? Find the number of orders per ship mode.
select	ship_mode, count(*)
from		public.orders
group by	ship_mode;

-- Q2. 	How many unique salespeople do we have employed in each region? 
-- 		How does that compare to the number of unique countries in each region?
select	region, count (distinct (salesperson)) as unique_salespeople, count (distinct (country)) as unique_country
from		public.regions
group by	region;

-- Q3. Find the most popular reason for returns.
select	reason_returned, sum(return_quantity) as total_return_quantity
from		public.returns
group by	reason_returned
order by	2 DESC
limit		1;

-- Q4. 	Bonus: Create a query that groups the total number of products available by vendor.
--  	The vendors we want to focus on are 3M, Apple, Avery, Cisco, Epson, Hewlett-
-- 		Packard (HP, Hewlett Packard), Logitech, Panasonic, Samsung, and Xerox.
select	count(*) as total_no_of_products, 
		case
			when product_name LIKE '%3M%' then '3M'
			when product_name LIKE '%Apple%' then 'Apple'
			when product_name LIKE '%Avery%' then 'Avery'
			when product_name LIKE '%Cisco%' then 'Cisco'
			when product_name LIKE '%Epson%' then 'Epson'
			when product_name LIKE '%Hewlett-Packard%' then 'Hewlett-Packard'
			when product_name LIKE '%Logitech%' then 'Logitech'
			when product_name LIKE '%Panasonic%' then 'Panasonic'
			when product_name LIKE '%Samsung%' then 'Samsung'
			when product_name LIKE '%Xerox%' then 'Xerox'
			else 'Others'
		end as vendor
from		public.products
group by	vendor
order by	1
limit		10;
