-- Homework 3 - Combining Data with JOINs
-- Q1. Which region saw the most returned items? For what reasons?
select 	g.region, sum(r.return_quantity)
from 		orders o
		JOIN regions g ON o.region_id = g.region_id
		JOIN returns r ON o.order_id = r.order_id
group by	g.region
limit 	1;

-- Q2. What product was returned most often? (products)
select 	p.product_name, sum(r.return_quantity)
from 		orders o
		JOIN products p ON o.product_id = p.product_id
		JOIN returns r ON o.order_id = r.order_id
group by	p.product_name
order by	2 DESC
limit 	1;

-- Q3. 	Which of our “top vendors” (3M, Apple, Avery, Cisco, Epson, Hewlett-
--		Packard (HP, Hewlett Packard), Logitech, Panasonic, Samsung, and Xerox)
--		saw the most returns?
select	total_returned_quantity, vendor

-- Q4. Which product is most profitable with the consumer segment?
select 	p.product_name, sum(o.profit) as total_profit
